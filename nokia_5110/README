This library is mostly taken from Adafuit.
For more information and even more libraries refer to their github page:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PCD8544-Nokia-5110-LCD-library
I don't own their work, so this is an adaptation for Makefiles and avr-gcc without arduino.

This program uses SPI and the INPUT and OUTPUT libraries.
